# Green-Quantized-FL-over-Wireless-Networks-An-Energy-Efficient-Design
This is a repository for the implementation of the paper "Green, Quantized Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: An Energy-Efficient Design".
"NBI_method" contains code for the introduced NBI method to find the Pareto boundary
Pytorch implementation of Quantized FL will be updated
